Wise decision to know more about me! 
Now serve yourself with a cup of coffee as I'm going to talk about some fun facts.

<summary>More About My Research</summary>
<p>
My research goal is to develop practical machine intelligence system to serve humanity. At this stage I focus on developing sample-efficient reinforcement algorithms. I'm particularly interested in the following topics.
</p>
<p>
<b>Principled Large-scale Deep RL</b>
<br>
Neural networks (NN) is powerful as function approximator but hard to train due to low data-efficiency, high variance, easy-to-overfitting nature. Some of my recent works aim to addressing such issues by empirical studies and overcome them by heuristic methods. Though there exists gap between classical RL with tarbular function or linear function approximation and DRL with non-linear function approximation, important facts of the former could inspire algorithm designing for large-scale problems.  
<br>
<br>
<b>Pretrain-Finetune Paradigm for DRL</b>
<br>
Pretraining with large dataset and finetuning on task-specific dataset has been the standard paradigm for CV & NLP. I expect similar framework for DRL under definite conditions. I'm interested in related areas e.g. transfer RL, multitask RL, meta RL, skill discovery, representation learning for RL, etc. and worked on a strongly related topic in my undergraduate thesis.
<br>
<br>
<b>Offline RL (Batch RL)</b>
<br>
Offline RL (batch RL) setting, in which online interaction is expensive but offline interactive data is cheap, is widespread in industial scenarios. There are limited previous works under the relaxed offline assumption. How to accelerate online training with offline data? How to distill knowledges from offline data? I’d like to find answers to these questions.
<br>
<br>
<b>Robot Learning </b>
<br>
Exploration in reality is expensive and needs extra ensurance of safety and robustness. Though I'm new to real robot learning, there are some potentially feasible plans I want to explore 1) combining encoded human knowledges (e.g. first-order soft logic) 2) more efficient utilization of simulated data.

<summary>About My Name</summary>
<p>
My Chinese name, 千里(Qianli), pronunced like ['tʃiænli], a little difficult for native English speakers according to my exerience in the US. 千里 is a Chinese unit of distance and 1 千里 is about 311 miles. This is exactly where my instagram ID <a href='https://www.instagram.com/about311miles/'> @about311miles </a>comes from.
</p>
<p>
My favorite English name is Peter. I was 11 and my English teacher gave this name to me. She told me Peter is a name for clever boys. (teacher Reacoo! you do have an eye! miss u so much!). Besides, I'm always a big fan of Spider Man. So I keep this name with me, waiting for my time to save the world! (who knows :))
