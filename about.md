Wise decision to know more about me! 
Now serve yourself with a cup of coffee as I'm going to talk about some fun facts.

<summary>More About My Research</summary>
<p>
Fascinated by the power of machine intelligence and concerned about the challenges faced by humans on the path to the AI era, I started my exploration of machine learning a few years ago. My research objective is twofold:
</p>
<p>
- First, to develop efficient algorithm for machine intelligence. The large amount of data and computing resource needed for training hamper the development of powerful machine intelligence. Data efficient and computationally efficient algorithms are needed to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>
- Second, to bridge the gap between research and practical application. Despite the theoretical guarantee for the power of neural networks (NN), models based on NN underperform traditional methods in terms of stability and robustness in many important areas like robotics. Further work is needed to utilize mathematically powerful models in real-world applications.

OK, everybody once or more heared about the power of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Machines do better image classification and language translation. Machines beat human players at Go and at MOBA games. Is that true? Yes, under the condition that you have sufficient computing resource and high-quality data. However, in most cases...

The success of machine learning is limited. The low data efficiency, high conputing cost and safety risk hamper the launch of machine learning systems (especially reinforcement learning systems) in industrial scenarios. Here are some questions I particularly curious about.
</p>
<p>
<b>How to take full advantage of data to achieve efficient learning?</b>
</p>
<p>
Learning with simulator is cheap, as one can generate huge amount of data without worrying about the cost. However, real data is expensive. Learning from imperfect data (limited, corrupted, imbalancd, distributionally shifted) is challanging. How can we handle these issues?
</p>
<p>
Another aspect of this problem is about the broad <b>data</b>, which refers to encoded knowledge from human or from prior learning experience. How to generate and encode these kind of knowledge? How to efficiently transfer it across models and tasks?
</p>
<p>
<b>How to construct safe and robust policy with limited data?</b>
</p>
<p>
Agents are sensitive to environment shift, and in multi-agent gaming, to adversarial policy. Sufficient data helps to ease these issues, but the truth is data is expensive, especially in practical scenarios. We need to design rules to constrain the agent during training. How to efficiently combine rules with training? How to automatically balance between constraint and learning?
</p>
<p>
There is still a long way for me to go before I can thoroughly answer any of these questions. My research will center on these Qs. And I'll update this part with new Qs or some As from time to time.

<summary>About My Name</summary>
<p>
My Chinese name, 千里(Qianli), pronunced like ['tʃiænli], a little difficult for native English speakers according to my exerience in the US. 千里 is a Chinese unit of distance and 1 千里 is about 311 miles. This is exactly where my instagram ID <a href='https://www.instagram.com/about311miles/'> @about311miles </a>comes from.

My favorite English name is Peter. I was 11 and my English teacher gave this name to me. She told me Peter is a name for clever boys. (teacher Reacoo! you do have an eye! miss u so much!). Besides, I'm always a big fan of Spider Man. So I keep this name with me, waiting for my time to save the world! (who knows :))
