Hi! This is Qianli Shen（沈千里）:) 

I’m now on my gap year working as a research intern at [Huawei Technologies Noah’s Ark Lab](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home). Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at [School of EECS](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in July 2020, advised by [Prof. Zhanxing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanxingzhu/). In summer 2019, I visited [School of (ISyE)](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), working with [Prof. Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/).

My research interests are in practical (data-efficient, safe & robust) **reinforcement learning** algorithms. I’m also interested in applying machine learning methods in industrial scenarios and developing high-performance ML softwares.

For some reason, my graduate study was postponed. (a peaceful and safe world plz :) ) Now I’m open to potential research positions. Collaborations, discussions and chats are always welcome!
